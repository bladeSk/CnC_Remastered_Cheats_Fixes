# Command & Conquer Remastered Cheats & Mods

This mod makes the games more enjoyable for me by fixing annoyances and adding optional tools for tinkering. I'm putting it up on Github, in case someone finds it useful.

Features:
* buildings blown up by TD commando no longer spawn soldiers and damage the commando
* building placement with a gap in TD (same behavior like in RA)
* instant building capture for RA engineers (same behavior like in TD)
* optionally disable/enable shroud with `Ctrl+Alt+H`
* optionally skip/win mission with `Ctrl+Alt+N` - useful for skipping early campaign missions

The mod is a continuation of work from this repository https://github.com/Revenent/CnC_Remastered_Collection which means it retains all the (optional) cheats, with two changes:

* replaces the no-damage mod with a mission skip key
* disables the harvester credits boost by default - the original mod completely broke the game balance by using the default value of a 1000% boost
* see all the optional cheats of the original mod here https://github.com/Revenent/CnC_Remastered_Collection/wiki/Tiberian-Dawn-Cheat-Mod
