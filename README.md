# Command & Conquer Remastered Cheats & Mods

Allows you to skip missions and remove the shroud, also fixes RA engineer (captures instantly) and TD commando (no damage from exploding buildings).

In other words, the mod makes the games more enjoyable for me, but I'm putting it up on Github, in case someone finds it useful.

Continues the work from this repository https://github.com/Revenent/CnC_Remastered_Collection with the following changes:

* replaces the no-damage mod with a mission skip key - useful for skipping early campaign missions
* disables the harvester credits boost by default - the original mod completely broke the game balance by using the default value of a 1000% boost
* makes RA engineers behave like TD engineers (instant capture)
* buildings blown up by TD commando no longer spawn soldiers and damage the commando
